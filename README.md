## The project has following ideas:
-- Keeping track of the information of the number of cars parked in a particular area.
## This is done in order to keep tracking vehicles hassle free and traffic free.
-- We can access the contact number of the owner of the car from the database.
-- We can contact that owner in case the car is parked above the wait limit.
## This solution could be used in areas like:
-- A wedding, where a lot of car is parked in a compact place.
--A metro parking
-- Parking near shops.
